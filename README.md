## Problem Statement

Create visualizations to represent HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs. Identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.

### Tools used - Power BI

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4: The data was good enough to start calculations
- Step 5: Created a new measure table to store all measures inside this table for clarity.
- Step 6: A measure to calculate the count of Total Employees & count of Leavers
            
            # of Employee = DISTINCTCOUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID])
            # of Leavers = CALCULATE(count('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes")
- Step 7: A measure to calculate the count of Men & Women Employees.
            
            # of Men = CALCULATE(Count('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="Male")
            # of Female = CALCULATE(Count('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="Female")
- Step 8:  A measure to calculate the hire percentage of Men & Women Employees.

            Men Hired % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE([# of Employee],'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="Male",'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"),CALCULATE([# of Employee],'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"))
            Women Hired % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE([# of Employee],'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="Female",'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"),CALCULATE([# of Employee],'Pharma Group AG'[New hire FY20?]="Y"))

- Step 9: A measure to calculate the percentage of Employees Promoted in (FY21) & Women Employees Promoted.

            % Employees promoted (FY21) = DIVIDE(CALCULATE([# of Employee],'Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY21?]="Yes"),[# of Employee])
            % of women promoted = DIVIDE(CALCULATE([# of Employee],'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="Female",'Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY21?]="Yes" || 'Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY20?]="Y"),[# of Employee])
- Step 10: A measure to calculate the Performance Rating of Men & Women.

            Men performance rating = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating]),'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="Male")
            Women performance rating = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating]),'Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="Female")
- Step 11: Slicers added for Department, Job level, Age Group & Region Group is added.
- Step 12 - Donut, bar & line charts are used to present the above data.
